                        Inspired by the work of the Vermont Reptile and Amphibian Atlas,
                        we experimented with different image processing techniques such
                        as changing aperture, image contrast and image composition to
                        determine the specifications optimized for classifying
                        reptiles/amphibians using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
                        In addition, we also tested the potential of our model in classifying
                        paired images, which were similar to the composition of the Atlas images.
                        Overall, image preprocessing techniques proved unsuccessful in improving
                        classification accuracy using an XCeption CNN model.
